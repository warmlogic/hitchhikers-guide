# Before You Start

So you want to start a DSSG project! First, please make sure you have
gone through the [Prerequisites](prerequisites/)
and [Software Setup](software-setup/) and are equipped with the basic knowledge and tools you'll need.
Then use our [Project Scoping
Intro](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/2016/10/27/scoping-data-science-for-social-good-projects/)
to help you scope or refine your project.
Then, check out [Pipelines and Project Workflow](pipelines-and-project-workflow/)

Donâ€™t forget to keep [best practices for your day to day workflow](./TechnicalWorkflowAndBestPractices.md) in mind.
