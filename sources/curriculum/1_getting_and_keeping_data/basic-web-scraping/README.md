# Web Scraping 101

## Background and Motivation

With the vast amount of data on the internet, an important question is how to to access it. Normally,
we just use a web browser to go to a website and view it manually. Other times a site may have a
data portal we can use to download curated data or they an API. In the case where there is useful
data stored in web pages we can create programs for the automatic and systematic gathering and
parsing of data from the web.
