## A little bit of theory

### Spatial database

-   Storage of spatial data
-   Analysis of geographic data
-   Manipulation of spatial objects just like the other database objects
    -   Creation of subsets of data
    -   Fixing geographic data
    -   \(\ldots\)
-   Database backend for apps


### Spatial data

-   Data which describes or represents either a location or a shape

-   Points, lines, polygons

-   Besides the geometrical properties, the spatial data has attributes.

-   Examples:
    -   Geocodable address
    -   Crime patterns
    -   EMS / patient location
    -   Weather information
    -   City planning
    -   Hazard detection


### Relationships

-   Proximity
-   Adjacency (touching, connectivity)
-   Containment


### Operations

-   Area
-   Length
-   Intersection
-   Union
-   Buffer


### Why a db instead of a file?

Spatial data is usually related to other types of data.


### How load data to the db?

-   `shp2pgsql`
    -   imports standard **esri** shapefiles and `dbf`

-   `ogr2ogr`
    -   imports 20 different vector and flat files


### The spatial data that is not spatial data

(the `disease`  and `date` columns are the **attributes** of this data)


### *shape files*

-   Stored in files on the computer
-   The most common one is probably the 'shape file'
    -   It consists of at least three different files that work together to store vector data

</tbody>
</table>


### Vector data

-   Is stored as a series of x,y coordinate pairs inside the computer's memory.
-   Vector data is used to represent **points** (1 vertex) , **lines** (polyline) (2 or more vertices, but the first and the last one are different) and **areas** (polygons).
-   A vector feature has its shape represented using *geometry*.
-   The geometry is made up of one or more interconnected vertices.
-   A vertex describes a position in space using an x, y and optionally z axis.
-   The x and y values will depend on the *coordinate reference system* (`CRS`) being used.


#### Problems with vector data

### Raster data

-   Stored as a grid of values
-   Each *cell* or *pixel* represents a geographical region, and the value of the pixel represents some attribute of the region
-   Use it when you want to represent a continuous information across an area
-   *Multi-band* images, each *band* contains different information

#### Problems with raster data

High resolution raster data requires a huge amount of computer storage.


## Exercise: Cleaning and exploring spatial data


Connect to the db

    host:  gis-tutorial.c5faqozfo86k.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com
    port: 5432
    username: dssg_gis
    password: dssg-gis
    db name:gis_tutorial

SSH Tunneling

    ssh -fNT -L \
        8889:gis-tutorial.c5faqozfo86k.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432  \
        -i ~/.ssh/your-dssh-key ec2-instance.dssg.io  ## ssh tunneling

Command line client

    psql -h localhost -p 8889 -U dssg_gis  gis_tutorial


### Setup

-   create an `schema` using your `github` account
    -   (mine is `nanounanue`)

```sql
    create schema your-github-username;
```

#### Upload the first shapefiles

-   There are several *shapefiles* in the `data` directory

-   First, we can see some information from the files

    ogrinfo -al roads.shp

Observe that the projection is

    ...
    projcs["nad83_massachusetts_mainland",
        geogcs["gcs_north_american_1983",
            datum["north_american_datum_1983",
                spheroid["grs_1980",6378137,298.257222101]],
            primem["greenwich",0],
            unit["degree",0.017453292519943295]],
        projection["lambert_conformal_conic_2sp"],
        parameter["standard_parallel_1",42.68333333333333],
        parameter["standard_parallel_2",41.71666666666667],
        parameter["latitude_of_origin",41],
        parameter["central_meridian",-71.5],
        parameter["false_easting",200000],
        parameter["false_northing",750000],
        unit["meter",1]]
    ...

This projection measures the **area** in meters. but

-   Using `shp2psql` tool upload the following files: `roads`, `land`, `hydrology`

        shp2psql --host=localhost --port=8889 --username=dssg_gis \
         -f roads.shp gis your-github-username.roads \
         | psql -h localhost -p 8889 -u dssg_gis  gis_tutorial
        ## if you want to change the projection to wgs 1984 (the one used in google maps)
        ## you need to add the flag -s 26986:4326 before the name of the database (gis)

If you open **QGIS** you should see something like the following:

![img](images/before.png)
*Figure: `land` (purple), `hydrology` (red) and `roads` (blue) after their insertion in the database*

and after some customization:

![img](images/after.png)
*Figure: After adjusting the style in **QGIS**: `land` (one color per type), `hydrology` (blue) and `roads` (yellow)*

note that we have *lands* over the *roads* and over the *water*.


### Spatial predicates for cleaning

-   We will use `st_intersects()`  and `st_dwithin()` for removing the land which
    is touch with roads and water, and if it is too far of roads and water, respectively

-   See the file <sql/unviable_land.sql> for the `sql` statements.

-   **NOTE:** For use of the `EXISTS(subquery)` look [here](http://www.techonthenet.com/postgresql/exists.php) and [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/functions-subquery.html)

![img](images/after_2.png)
*Figure: After removing the land objects which intersects roads or water or where too far from those*

-   `St_intersects(a,b)`  returns `true`  if exists at least one point in common between the geometrical objects `a` and `b`.

-   `St_dwithin(a,b,distance)` returns `true` if the geometries `a` and `b` are within the specified distance of one another.

-   Other functions: `st_equals`, `st_disjoint`, `st_touches`, `st_crosses`, `st_overlaps`, `st_contains`.


### Add more data: `buildings` and `residents`

Upload to the database the shapefiles `buildings` and `residents`.

    ## This time I will use ogr2ogr, but this is for demostration purpose only
    ## It is easier use shp2pgsql
    ogr2ogr -f "PostgreSQL" \
     PG:"host=localhost user=dssg_gis dbname=gis_tutorial password=dssg-gis port=8889" \
      buildings.shp -nln your-github-username.buildings


### Spatial joins: creating new views

-   As you can see, <data/my_town/residents.psv> is not a spatial data.
    It is a regular `psv`  file. But it contains the `pid`  of the land in
    which the resident lives.

    csvhead -d '|' ./data/my_town/residents.psv | head

How can I convert this data in spatial data?

```sql
    select
    r.*  -- All the attributes of resident
    , st_centroid(l.the_geom) -- The centroid of the land in which this resident lives
    from
    residents as r
    inner join -- only the matches
    land as l
    on
    r.pid = l.pid;
```

Ok, very well. But, How can I see this new "data" in **QGIS**? You need to create a `view`

```sql
    create or replace view residents_loc
    as
    select
    row_number() over() as rl_id -- We need an unique identifier
    , r.*  -- All the attributes of resident
    , st_centroid(l.the_geom) as the_geom -- The centroid of the land in which this resident lives
    from
    residents as r
    inner join -- only the matches
    land as l
    on
    r.pid = l.pid;
```

![img](images/residents_loc.png)
*Figure: After the creation of the view `residents_loc` (red star)*


### Spatial operations: Legal issues in our town

How much real state area do we have?

```sql
    select
    sum(st_area(the_geom))/1000000 as total_sq_km
    , st_area(st_union(the_geom))/1000000 as no_overlap_total_sq_km
    -- st_union dissolves the overlaps!
    from land;
```

Oh, oh. And  buildings?

```sql
    select
    sum(st_area(the_geom))/1000000 as total_sq_km
    , st_area(st_union(the_geom))/1000000 as no_overlap_total_sq_km
    from buildings;
```
-   We have buildings inside buildings, and some lands overlaps with other lands `:(`

-   Other operations: `st_intersection(a,b)`, `st_difference(a,b)`, `st_symdifference(a,b)`, `st_buffer(c)`, `st_convexhull(c)`


### Spatial joins: Which lands intersects?

```sql
    select
    p.pid -- the land
    , count(o.pid) as total_intersections -- qty of intersections
    , array_agg(o.pid) as intersected_parcels -- the other lands
    from
    land as p
    inner join
    land as o
    on
    (p.pid <> o.pid and st_intersects(p.the_geom, o.the_geom))
    group by p.pid
    order by p.pid;
    -- First row returned: pid IN ('000000225', '000027745','000092727','000057051')
```

Which type of overlap?

```sql
    select
    count(o.pid) as total_intersections
    -- Overlaps?
    , count(case when st_overlaps(o.the_geom,p.the_geom) then 1 else null end) as o_overlaps_p
    -- It is the same?
    , count(case when st_equals(o.the_geom,p.the_geom) then 1 else null end) as o_equals_p
    from land as p
    inner join land as o
    on (p.pid <> o.pid and st_intersects(p.the_geom, o.the_geom));
```

-   `st_overlaps(a,b)` returns `true` if the geometries share some but not all the points, and the intersection has the same dimension as `a`, `b`


### Cleaning the mess: Reassigning residents

```sql
    update residents
    set pid = a.newpid
    from (
    select p.pid, min(o.pid) as newpid
    from land as p
    inner join
    land as o on
    (p.pid = o.pid or st_equals(p.the_geom, o.the_geom))
    group by p.pid
    having p.pid <> min(o.pid)) as a
    where residents.pid = a.pid
    returning * -- Return all the updated residents
    -- so you can see what you just do
    -- (or you can store it in a another table using CTAS)
```

### Cleaning the mess: Deleting the dupe land

```sql
    -- Add a new column for storing the house types
    alter table land add column land_type_other varchar[];

    -- Copy the types to the first parcel
    update land
    set land_type_other = a.dupe_types
    from (
    select p.pid
    , min(o.pid) as newpid
    , array_agg(distinct o.land_type) as dupe_types
    from land as p
    inner join land as o
    on
    (st_equals(p.the_geom, o.the_geom))
    group by p.pid
    having count(p.pid) > 1 and p.pid = min(o.pid)
    ) as a
    where land.pid = a.pid
    returning *;

    -- Delete the parcels
    delete from land
    where pid in
    (select p.pid
    from land as p inner join land as o on
    (st_equals(p.the_geom, o.the_geom))
    group by p.pid
    having count(p.pid) > 1 and p.pid <> min(o.pid)) ;
```

### Spatial analytics: Questions

How many kinds under 12 are further than a km of an elementary school?

```sql
    select
    sum(num_children_b12)*100.00/(select sum(num_children_b12) from residents)
    from residents as r
    inner join land as l on r.pid = l.pid
    left join (
    select pid, the_geom from land
    where
    land_type = 'elementary school'
    or
    'elementary school' = any(land_type_other)
    ) as eschools
    on st_dwithin(l.the_geom, eschools.the_geom, 1000)
    where eschools.pid is null;
```

How much area are in empty lands?

```sql
    select st_area(st_union(the_geom))/1000000
    from land
    where
    land_type = 'vacant land';
```

Which are the 10 nearest houses to the lakes?

```sql
    select h.hyd_name,
    array(
    select bldg_name
    from buildings b
    where
    b.bldg_type like '%family'
    order by h.the_geom <#> b.the_geom limit 5
    )
    from hydrology h
    where h.hyd_name in  ('lake 1', 'elephantine youth');
```

## Exercise: Mapping civilizations


### Intro

-   Recently this article was published: [*Spatializing 6,000 years of global urbanization from 3700 BC to AD 2000* **Reba, M., Reitsma, F. and Seto, C.**, 2016](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201634#data-records)
-   The article describes all the cities since 3700 BC, including name, population and the position (latitude, longitude).
-   We will use a subset (`chandlerV2`) of the data for transforming it to a table, and then generating a `geojson`.


### Uploading the data

-   Run the following inside `./data/Historical Urban Population Growth Data`

    cvslook chandlerV2.csv

-   It will fail due some encoding issues

        iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 chandlerV2.csv > chandler_utf8.csv
        csvsql --db postgresql://dssg_gis:dssg-gis@localhost:8889/gis_tutorial \
        --insert chandlerV2_utf8.csv --table chandler --db-schema nanounanue

### `SQL` stuff

```sql
    select count(*) from chandler;  -- How many cities do we have?
```

Let’s create a new table for easier manipulation

```sql
    create table cities as -- CTAS
    select
    "City" as city,
    "Country" as country,
    "Latitude" as y_lat,
    "Longitude" as x_lon from chandler;
```

Adding a geometry column and transform to `Point`

```sql
    alter table cities add column geom geometry(Point, 4326);
    -- Transforming Lon/Lat to Points
    update cities set geom = ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(x_lon, y_lat), 4326);
```

Converting to `GeoJSON`

```sql
    \copy (
     select row_to_json(fc)
     from (
        select 'featurecollection' as type, array_to_json(array_agg(f)) as features
        from (
          select 'feature' as type
          , st_asgeojson(cities.geom)::json as geometry
          , row_to_json(
            (select c from (select city, country) as c)
          ) as properties
          from cities
        ) as f
      )  as fc)
    to '~/cities.geojson';
```

-   This type of file could be used with `d3.js` for making interactive plots.

-   For better performance you could use `topojson`
