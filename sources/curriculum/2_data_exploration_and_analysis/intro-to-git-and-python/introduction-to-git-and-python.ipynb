    "This course is a practical introduction to the methods and tools that the social scientist can use to make sense of big data, and thus programming resources are also important. We make extensive use of the Python programming language and SQL database management. We recommend that any social scientist who aspires to work with large datasets become proficient in the use of these two systems as well as Github. All three, fortunately, are quite accessible and supported by excellent online resources. "

    "** Why version control?** \n",
    "Version control is like a lab notebook for your digital projects. It enables you and your collaborators to work on a project simultaneously, rather than waiting for someone else to make edits before you can add yours, or poring over every line to try to assimilate changes from multiple editors. It allows you to return to previous versions of documents, like an \"undo\" button. It allows you to free your file system of names like `paper_final_FINAL_JZ_edits.doc` without fear that your work will be lost, overwritten, or duplicated. Version control is also useful to keep track of what you've done and when on your own research projects; if, in a year's time, you discover an error in your analysis, or want to investigate or change your process in any way, Future You will be grateful to have a record of what you did and when. \n",
