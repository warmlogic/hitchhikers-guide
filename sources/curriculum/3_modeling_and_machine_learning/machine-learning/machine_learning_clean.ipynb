    "# Glossary of Terms \n",
    "- **Learning**: In machine learning, you'll hear about \"learning a model.\" This is what you probably know as \n",
    "*fitting* or *estimating* a function, or *training* or *building* a model. These terms are all synonyms and are \n",
    "used interchangeably in the machine learning literature.\n",
    "- **Examples**: These are what you probably know as *data points* or *observations*. \n",
    "- **Features**: These are what you probably know as *independent variables*, *attributes*, *predictors*, \n",
    "or *explanatory variables.*\n",
    "- **Underfitting**: This happens when a model is too simple and does not capture the structure of the data well \n",
    "enough.\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: This happens when a model is too complex or too sensitive to the noise in the data; this can\n",
    "result in poor generalization performance, or applicability of the model to new data. \n",
    "- **Regularization**: This is a general method to avoid overfitting by applying additional constraints to the model. \n",
    "For example, you can limit the number of features present in the final model, or the weight coefficients applied\n",
    "to the (standardized) features are small.\n",
    "- **Supervised learning** involves problems with one target or outcome variable (continuous or discrete) that we want\n",
    "to predict, or classify data into. Classification, prediction, and regression fall into this category. We call the\n",
    "set of explanatory variables $X$ **features**, and the outcome variable of interest $Y$ the **label**.\n",
    "- **Unsupervised learning** involves problems that do not have a specific outcome variable of interest, but rather\n",
    "we are looking to understand \"natural\" patterns or groupings in the data - looking to uncover some structure that \n",
    "we do not know about a priori. Clustering is the most common example of unsupervised learning, another example is \n",
    "principal components analysis (PCA).\n"

    "It's not enough to just build the model; we're going to need a way to know whether or not it's working. Convincing others of the quality of results is often the *most challenging* part of an analysis.  Making repeatable, well-documented work with clear success metrics makes all the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convince ourselves - and others - that our modeling results will generalize, we need to hold\n",
    "some data back (not using it to train the model), then apply our model to that hold-out set and \"blindly\" predict, comparing the model's predictions to what we actually observed. This is called **cross-validation**, and it's the best way we have to estimate how a model will perform on *entirely* novel data. We call the data used to build the model the **training set**, and the rest the **test set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we'd like our training set to be as large as possible, to give our model more information. However, you also want to be as confident as possible that your model will be applicable to new data, or else the model is useless. In practice, you'll have to balance these two objectives in a reasonable way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also many ways to split up your data into training and testing sets. Since you're trying to evaluate how your model will perform *in practice*, it's best to emulate the true use case of your model as closely as possible when you decide how to evaluate it. A good [tutorial on cross-validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html) can be found on the `scikit-learn` site.\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple and commonly used method is ***k-fold* cross-validation**, which entails splitting up our dataset into *k* groups, holding out one group while training a model on the rest of the data, evaluating model performance on the held-out \"fold,\" and repeating this process *k* times (we'll get back to this in the text-analysis tutorial). Another method is **temporal cross-validation**, which involves building a model using all the data up until a given point in time, and then testing the model on observations that happened after that point. Our problem of recidivism is a problem in time where we are trying to predcit an event in the future. Generally, if you use the future to predict the past there will be temporal effects that will help the accuracy of your predictions. We cannot use the future to predict the past in real life, so it is important to use `temporal cross-validation` and create our training and test sets accordingly. \n",
