# Usability and User Interface Design

## Motivation
When you're working on data science for social good projects, you'll usually be partnering with (or working within) an
organization, and there will be many stakeholders, or people who influence or will be influenced by your work. These
stakeholders will be both within and outside the organization, including you, whoever is funding the work, the people
who create and collect the data, and the people who are actually affected by your analysis and the decisions it drives.
To make sure that your work is creating a useful and usable solution to a real problem (and not just wasting your and
everyone else's time), we borrow some ideas from the school of agile development.
