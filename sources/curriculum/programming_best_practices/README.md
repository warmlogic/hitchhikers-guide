# Programming Best Practices

As you begin to work on larger, more complicated projects, and work in teams with other programmers, you'll save yourself
and your teammates a lot of grief and frustration by writing [legible, good code](legible-good-code/) and
[writing tests](test-test-test/). You'll also need to document and package up your work so that
other people can understand and reproduce your results, so check out the [reproducible software](reproducible-software/)
tutorial. As you continue to develop these skills, you'll start to change settings and configurations for various
applications, so check out [pimp my dotfiles](pimp-my-dotfiles/) for some tips on how to
customize the environments you're working in.
