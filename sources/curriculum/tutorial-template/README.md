# Tutorial Template Session: Making Meringues

## Motivation

_A very brief abstract._

This tutorial teaches the basics of making meringues. These simple preparations from sugar and eggwhites are an integral part of many french-inspired desserts and surprisingly easy to make.

## Potential Teachouts

_Always include a list of relevant, more advanced topics, and encourage fellows to teach them in the coming weeks. Jane is running the schedule for fellow teachouts._

This tutorial only covers the very basics of making meringues. If you are an experienced baker, please share your knowledge and schedule a fellow teachout! Here are some topics that would be helpful:
- flavored meringues
- marbled meringues
- recipes with meringues

_If you have worksheets for fellows to go through during the session, place them in a `worksheets` folder, and also include solutions for future reference!_

## Cheat Sheet

_This section is only necessary for tech sessions, but important! It should list all relevant commands with very brief explanations for quick future reference._
